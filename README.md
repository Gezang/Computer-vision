# SF2935-Project

This repository is for a project in computer vision.

We compare two models (CNN and SVM) for classifying brain tumor MRIs

## Structure of the code

The code in 'network.ipynb' can be used to recreate the results we obtained. The code is divided into sections as follows:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Plotting some samples (Augmented)
3. Build and train CNN
4. Build and train SVM
5. Analysis of both models performance.

## Data:

The data can be downloaded either through Kaggles website or by running the code in download-data.ipynb. (One might need to change the directory where the code looks for the data.)
